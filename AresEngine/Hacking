Engineering Conventions:
========================

Language
----------
English (Canadian) should be used for everything non-localized, such as variable
names, functions, comments, skeletal join names, and so on. Localized content 
can be in whatever. All non-binary files should be encoded in UTF-8 unless 
stated otherwise. 


Variables
---------
Hungarian notation is not used. Variables / objects are prefixed only for scope.

    * g_Foo  : member foo of a global namespace
    * m_Foo  : member foo of a structure/class
    * ms_Foo : static member foo of a class


Mathematical
------------

    Angles
    ------
    All angles are provided in degrees, not radians, unless specified otherwise.


    Floats
    ------
    Unless noted otherwise, all floating point calculations are done in single
    precision.


    Quaternions
    -----------
    Each component stored contiguously as (W, X, Y, Z)


    Matrices
    --------
    Unless noted otherwise, all matrices are stored in column-major order. C++ 
    stores arrays in row-major order (sequence of rows in linear memory), but 
    column-major was selected because it makies communication with OpenGL and GLSL
    simpler.


    Transformations
    ---------------
    All scales must be uniform. This is a major performance optimization because it
    ensures bounding spheres never become ellipsoid and only a 1/3 of the data for a
    non-uniform scale is required.
