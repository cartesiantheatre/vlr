These files were taken from NASA's Science Digital Data Preservation Task 
(SDDPT) magnetic tape number 1422. They were released by NASA under the public 
domain. We use them here to perform a sample recovery pass for the 'make check' 
target to recover camera event 22D180 taken on mission solar day 233.

The first and last file are compressed inside of 'stuff.zip', but the three 
together form a composite image. Some files are inside of the zip to test the
utility's ability to perform extraction and recognition from within the 
compressed archive and combine with uncompressed files.

The 'check' target will compare your sample recovery's machine generated 
metadata and the actual reconstructed image generated against a previous known 
to be successful sample run on the same input data.
