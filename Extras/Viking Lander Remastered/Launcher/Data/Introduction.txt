Dear User,

The <i>Avaneya: Viking Lander Remastered</i> project has an interesting story behind it, one which began with the <a href="https://www.avaneya.com">Avaneya</a> project. The Avaneya project is a grass roots collaborative initiative to produce a libre, DRM free, cerebral, science fiction game primarily targeting, albeit not exclusively limited to, users of the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-users-never-heard-of-gnu.html">GNU operating system</a>. This operating system has been made popular through its various distributions, such as <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a>. Although the game is still in its infancy at the time of writing, it would be naive to conclude that it has not endured several years worth of critical research and design already, of which, a significant consequence you have before you now.

Avaneya takes place in the not too distant future on Mars, predominantly in a specific region known as <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcadia_planitia">Arcadia Planitia</a></i>. This is approximately mid-latitude in the Red Planet's northern hemisphere.

While designing Avaneya, we realized just how important getting the game experience right was to us. We needed to replicate the visual environmental conditions of the Martian environment as carefully as possible. We could do much better than simply making it red, and users appreciate an earnest effort at a sincere visual experience. As such, our artists required access to large sets of high resolution reference images for study. 

The closest relevant photographs available at present were taken in a neighbouring region near <i>Arcadia Planitia</i> called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_Planitia"><i>Utopia Planitia</i></a> during the late 1970s by NASA's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_program">Viking mission</a> to Mars. This region is very similar to <i>Arcadia Planitia</i> in appearance.

In 1976 NASA successfully placed two Viking spacecraft into Martian orbit after many years of <a href="http://www.marsnews.com/missions/allmissions.html">failed</a> American and Russian attempts. These initial failures became unofficially known as the "Mars Curse" owing to their high number. The Viking orbiters both carried their own landers which successfully landed, one of which in the aforementioned <i>Utopia Planitia</i> region.

The landers were capable of capturing high resolution photographs and other data from the surface of the planet, buffering data temporarily within internal magnetic tapes and then relaying it back to Earth through one the orbiters when in position or sometimes directly over a UHF uplink whenever possible. The landers provided us with large amounts of data without any issues for four years before finally succumbing to a battery failure on one and a software update bug which shutdown the communication antenna on the other.

An <a href="http://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/volumes/viking.html">online archive</a> of all of the mission data was released into the public domain. However, due to the way this data was encoded and archived with the technology of the 1970s, it is unfortunately virtually impossible for the layman to find any recognizably photographic data in the archive. To find a complete colour photograph is a non-trivial exercise. At the time of writing, NASA still had <a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/planetaryfaq.html#Viking-lander">not released</a> the complete set of high resolution user accessible images on disc.

Needing the archive for our own creative purposes, yet willing to share our solution with the world in answer to a large degree of public interest, we set out to author a digital forensic archaeological tool to recover whatever we could of the landers' photographic mission data in a simple and easy to use manner. This software became known as the <i>Avaneya: Viking Lander Remastered</i>. 

True, we could have simply provided the recovered images alone, but we knew that the <i>libre</i> community, hobbyists in particular, would have found it far more intriguing to have taken part directly in their own digital forensic recovery effort before reliving the original breathtaking experience that marked the first successful moment in history that man saw Mars - not as a distant and impersonal celestial body it was known for centuries prior through the telescope, but as if he had actually been standing there seeing it with his own eyes.

In addition, given that there has also been a public outcry for <i>libre</i> commercial gaming titles for the GNU operating system for more than a decade, we realized that our fans would realize that their support in purchasing a copy of this software on DVD from us would be critical in sustaining a project wanting of high quality engineers and artists so that we could complete Avaneya.

Nearly anything else you may wish to know about the Avaneya project you can find in our project bible, the <i>Avaneya Project Crew Handbook</i>. For instance, there is a chapter titled <i>Viking Lander Remastered</i> which elaborates further on this software. You will be given an opportunity momentarily to download a complementary copy of the latest revision of this book to enjoy at your leisure.

On behalf of all of us, we would like to extend our gratitude for your having taken the time to support this project. Avaneya has an exciting future ahead of it. We hope that you will choose to be a part of it.
