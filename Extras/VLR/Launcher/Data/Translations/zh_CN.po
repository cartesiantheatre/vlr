"The <i>Avaneya: Viking Lander Remastered</i> initiative has an interesting "

"science fiction game primarily targeting, albeit not exclusively limited to, "
"users of the <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-users-never-heard-of-"
"gnu.html\">GNU operating system</a>. This operating system has been made "
"popular through its various distributions, such as <a "
"href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com\">Ubuntu</a>. Although the game is still in its "
