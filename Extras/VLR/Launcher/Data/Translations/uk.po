"The <i>Avaneya: Viking Lander Remastered</i> initiative has an interesting "
"story behind it, one which began with the <a "
"href=\"https://www.avaneya.com\">Avaneya</a> project. Avaneya is a grass "
"roots collaborative undertaking to produce a libre, DRM free, cerebral, "
"science fiction game primarily targeting, albeit not exclusively limited to, "
"users of the <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-users-never-heard-of-"
"gnu.html\">GNU operating system</a>. This operating system has been made "
"popular through its various distributions, such as <a "
"href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com\">Ubuntu</a>. Although the game is still in its "
"infancy at the time of writing, it would be naïve to conclude that it has "
"not endured several years worth of critical research and design already, of "
"which, a significant consequence you have before you now.\n"
"\n"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Avaneya will take place in the not too distant future on Mars, predominantly "
"in a real region known now as <i><a "
"href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcadia_planitia\">Arcadia "
"Planitia</a></i>. This is approximately mid-latitude in the Red Planet's "
"northern hemisphere.\n"
"\n"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While designing Avaneya, we realized just how important getting the game "
"experience right was to us. We needed to replicate the visual environmental "
"conditions of the Martian environment as carefully as possible. We could do "
"much better than simply making it red, and users appreciate an earnest "
"effort at a sincere visual experience. As such, our artists required access "
"to large sets of high resolution reference material for study.\n"
"\n"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The closest relevant photographs available at present were taken in a "
"neighbouring region near <i>Arcadia Planitia</i> called <a "
"href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_Planitia\"><i>Utopia "
"Planitia</i></a> during the late 1970s by NASA's <a "
"href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_program\">Viking mission</a> to "
"Mars. This region is very similar to <i>Arcadia Planitia</i> in appearance.\n"
"\n"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In 1976 NASA successfully placed two Viking spacecraft into Martian orbit "
"after many years of <a "
"href=\"http://www.marsnews.com/missions/allmissions.html\">failed</a> "
"American and Russian attempts. These initial failures became unofficially "
"known as the <i>\"Mars Curse\"</i> owing to their high number. The Viking "
"orbiters both carried their own landers which successfully landed, one of "
"which in the aforementioned <i>Utopia Planitia</i> region.\n"
"\n"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The landers were capable of capturing high resolution photographs and other "
"data from the surface of the planet, buffering data temporarily within "
"internal magnetic tapes and then relaying it back to Earth through one of "
"the orbiters when in position or sometimes directly over a UHF uplink "
"whenever possible. They provided us with large sets of data without any "
"major issue for four years before finally succumbing to a battery failure on "
"one and a software update bug which shutdown the communication antenna on "
"the other.\n"
"\n"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An <a href=\"http://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/volumes/viking.html\">online "
"archive</a> of all of the mission data was released into the public domain. "
"However, due to the way this data was encoded and archived with the "
"technology of the 1970s, it is unfortunately virtually impossible for the "
"layman to find any recognizably photographic data in the archive. We "
"contacted NASA's <a href=\"http://pds.nasa.gov/about/about.shtml\">Planetary "
"Data System</a> responsible for the archival of planetary missions. They "
"informed us that the data was produced <i>\"during the mission for use in "
"operations, probably in a rather hectic working environment, and were not "
"intended for archiving. In those pre-PDS days nobody gave much thought to "
"archiving,\"</i> (1 June 2011).\n"
"\n"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To find a complete colour photograph is a non-trivial exercise. At the time "
"of writing, NASA still had <a "
"href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/planetaryfaq.html#Viking-"
"lander\">not released</a> the complete set of high resolution user "
"accessible images on disc. During our communication, NASA noted that they "
"did <i>\"not know what format they would be in or whether there is any "
"existing software to read them. There is not a complete index of individual "
"color images, so it would require going through the [original archive] to "
"extract the color data from all the rest of the material that has been "
"saved. This is beyond the purview of [Planetary Data System]. Are you "
"interested in doing this?\"</i> (24 May 2011).\n"
"\n"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We did not know what to do at this point, so we asked NASA if they would "
"reconsider tackling this problem. They were better qualified and it would "
"have been beneficial to them during a time of fiscal austerity which "
"presented new challenges to public space exploration programs. We reasoned "
"that renewed public interest in the Red Planet was a good thing, and this "
"archive in particular would be especially useful, given that it would enable "
"anyone to relive the original breathtaking experience that captured the "
"world's attention. It marked the first successful moment in history that man "
"saw Mars - not as a distant and impersonal celestial body as it had been "
"known for centuries prior through telescopes, but as if he had actually been "
"standing there with his own eyes. They were, after all, the first successful "
"photographs ever taken from the surface of Mars. Nevertheless, NASA "
"indicated that the recovery effort was unfortunately not logistically "
"feasible at the time. <i>\"We have to prioritize, and we just don't have the "
"resources now to restore these images,\"</i> (25 May 2011).\n"
"\n"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We contemplated undertaking the significant challenge ourselves, but were "
"very much intimidated. <i>\"The images were created using old hardware and "
"software and therefore will require some digital archaeology to read now. "
"The software was VICAR, which is <a href=\"http://www-"
"mipl.jpl.nasa.gov/external/vicar.html\">still used</a> at the JPL "
"Multimission Instrument Processing Lab, although I doubt the current version "
"can read these images,\"</i> (25 May 2011). They followed up several days "
"later noting that <i>\"modern VICAR has evolved so much that it will most "
"likely be unable to read these old files, and I think you have demonstrated "
"that,\"</i> (1 June 2012).\n"
"\n"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Needing the archive for our own creative purposes, yet willing to share our "
"solution with everyone in response to a large degree of public interest, we "
"set out to author a digital forensic archaeological tool to recover whatever "
"we could of the landers' photographic mission data in a simple and easy to "
"use manner. This software became known as the <i>Avaneya: Viking Lander "
"Remastered</i>.\n"
"\n"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"True, we could have simply provided the recovered images alone, but we knew "
"that the <i>libre</i> community, hobbyists in particular, would have found "
"it far more intriguing to have taken part directly in their own digital "
"forensic recovery effort. In addition, given that there has also been a "
"public outcry for <i>libre</i> commercial gaming titles for the GNU "
"operating system for more than a decade, we realized that our fans would "
"understand that their support in purchasing a copy of this software on DVD "
"from us would be critical in sustaining a project as ever wanting of high "
"quality engineers and artists as it is in striving to minimize any reliance "
"on charity.\n"
