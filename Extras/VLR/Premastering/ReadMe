=== Introduction =====================================================

    We would like to extend our gratitude to you for having taken the 
    time to support this project in purchasing a copy of the Avaneya: 
    Viking Lander Remastered DVD. This is critical in sustaining a 
    project as ever wanting of high quality engineers and artists as 
    it is in striving to minimize any reliance on charity. 

    We hope that you will enjoy this product. Avaneya has an exciting 
    future ahead of it. We hope that you will choose to be a part of 
    it.

    Please visit us on the web at www.avaneya.com.

    * 600 MB of available Hard Drive Space 

    * 512 MB RAM 

    * DVD Optical Drive 

    * GNU Operating System (one of Ubuntu 12.04.2–13.04; Kubuntu 
      12.04.2–13.04; Lubuntu 12.10–13.04; Ubuntu Studio 13.04; Xubuntu
      13.04; Debian 7.0; Fedora 19; Linux Mint 15; or OpenSUSE 12.3)

    * Python 3

    * freedesktop.org friendly desktop environment (one of Gnome, KDE, 
      LXDE, MATE, Unity, or Xfce)

    * Keyboard

    * Mouse

    * Internet connectivity recommended

=== Quick Start ======================================================

    If you met the minimum system requirements and auto-run is enabled 
    in your GNU desktop environment, then just insert the DVD into 
    your drive and it should start automatically. If it does not, 
    browse the root of your DVD and run the 'autorun' program 
    manually. If that doesn't work either, eject the DVD, and keep 
    reading.

=== Checking Prerequisites ===========================================

    (1) First begin by making sure your system is up to date. If you
    are using Ubuntu, run the following with a valid internet 
    connection.

        $ sudo apt-get update
        $ sudo apt-get upgrade

    (2) The software on the DVD will try to automatically detect what 
    it needs that might be missing on your system before it can run by 
    alerting you, but in the event this fails, make sure you have the 
    following packages installed before inserting the DVD. The exact 
    names vary from distro to distro, but on Ubuntu Raring (13.04) 
    they are as follows.

        gir1.2-gst-plugins-base-1.0
        gir1.2-gtk-3.0
        gir1.2-vte-2.90
        gstreamer1.0-alsa
        gstreamer1.0-plugins-base
        gstreamer1.0-plugins-good
        libgstreamer1.0-0
        python3
        python3-cairo
        python3-gi
        python3-gi-cairo
        zenity

=== Checking Auto-Run ================================================

    (3) Next ensure that auto-run is enabled in your desktop 
    environment because sometimes the default setting is to disable 
    it. How to do this depends on which desktop environment you are 
    using.

    * Gnome 3

        Applications -> Settings -> Details -> Removable Media

        Make sure the "Software" selector is set to "Autorun Prompt" 
        and the "Never prompt or start programs on media insertion" is
        not enabled.

    * KDE 4

        At the time of writing, KDE doesn't appear to have auto-run 
        functionality implemented. See the section below on Starting 
        Manually.

    * LDXE

        At the time of writing, LXDE doesn't appear to have auto-run 
        functionality implemented. See the section below on Starting 
        Manually.

    * MATE

        Menu -> Control Centre -> File Management -> Media tab.

        Make sure the Software selector is set to "Open Autorun 
        Prompt" and the "Never prompt or start programs on media 
        insertion" is not enabled.

    * Unity

        System Settings -> Details -> Removable Media

        Make sure the "Software" selector is set to "Autorun Prompt" 
        and the "Never prompt or start programs on media insertion" is
        not enabled.

    * Xfce

        Settings -> Removable Drives and Media -> Storage tab

        Verify that "Auto-run programs on new drives and media", 
        "Mount removable drives when hot-plugged", and "Mount 
        removable media when inserted" are all enabled.

    Note that auto-run is never a security risk. Unlike on some legacy 
    operating systems, *cough*, when properly implemented it will 
    always prompt the user for confirmation before automatically 
    starting an application from removable media.

=== Starting via Auto-Run ============================================

    (4) If you didn't already eject the disc, make sure it is now.

    (5) Insert the disc and wait a moment. The software should start
    automatically. If it does not, see below.

=== Starting Manually ================================================

    (6) Insert the disc.

    (7) You can start the software manually through your desktop 
    environment's file browser, such as Thunar or Nautilus. Navigate
    to the root of the disc and double click on the 'autorun' file.

    (8) If still nothing happens, try starting the software manually
    by opening a terminal and running the following, substituting
    "path_to_disc_root" for the actual path to the root of the disc on
    your system.

        $ path_to_disc_root/autorun

    (9) The software should start at this point. If it does not, a
    reason should be given on the terminal. If you want to skip the
    distro identification and package prerequisite checks, set the
    VLR_SKIP_CHECKS environment variable before running autorun.

        $ export VLR_SKIP_CHECKS=1
        $ ./autorun

    (10) If you still cannot get it to start, see the Support section
    below.

=== VikingExtractor Command Line Interface ===========================

    If you would prefer to use the VikingExtractor command line 
    interface directly instead of the graphical user interface, you
    can access the manual for the former as follows, substituting
    "path_to_disc_root" for the actual path to the root of the disc on
    your system.

        $ cd path_to_disc_root
        $ man Extractor/Manual/viking-extractor.1
