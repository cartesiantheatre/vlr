.SH NAME
viking-extractor - Recovers images from Viking Lander operations

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B viking-extractor 
[\fIOPTIONS\fR] input [output]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Converts 1970s Viking Lander era VICAR colour images to PNGs. The value of 'input' can be either a single VICAR file or a directory containing VICAR files to attempt reconstruction into the provided output directory.

For some background information on why this tool was written, see the chapter \fBViking Lander Remastered\fR in the \fBAvaneya Project Crew Handbook\fR.

.SH OPTIONS

\fB\--directorize-band-class\fR
Put reconstructed images into subdirectories named after band type class (e.g. Colour).

.TP
\fB\--directorize-location\fR
Put reconstructed images into subdirectories named after location taken from.

.TP 
\fB\--directorize-month\fR
Put reconstructed images into subdirectories named after Martian month taken on.

.TP
\fB\--directorize-sol\fR
Put reconstructed images into subdirectories numbered by camera event solar day.

.TP
\fB\--dry-run\fR
Don't write anything.

.TP 
\fB\--help\fR
Show this help.

.TP 
\fB--ignore-bad-files\fR

.TP 
\fB\-r\fR, \fB--recursive\fR
Scan subfolders as well if input is a directory.
