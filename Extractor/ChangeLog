    * LogicalRecord.cpp (operator<<): Scrub unexpected null bytes, possibly from 
      bit rot.
    * configure.ac (AC_INIT): Version bump to 0.93.
    * VikingExtractor.cpp (main): Unhandled exceptions which ought to have been 
      handled.

    * VicarImageBand.cpp (GetRawBandData): Optimized by roughly 15.4 % with 
      preallocated buffers and reading larger pixel blocks per pass.
    * Makefile.am (check): Don't ever recycle artifacts when running test suite
      in case previous results are fine, even though newer executable crashed 
      during testing.
    * VicarImageBand.cpp (ExtractOCR): Optimized by roughly 9.3 % with faster
      flattening of pixel buffer.
    * VicarImageBand.cpp (ExtractOCR): Optimized by roughly 23.3 % with caching.
    * VicarImageAssembler.cpp (AddProspectiveFile): Give more user feedback over
      dbus while indexing files on media.
    * VicarImageBand.cpp (Load): Don't perform orientation detection on any PSA 
      band types that don't need it. Immeasurable performance increase.
    * Options.cpp (SetFilterDiodeClass): Allow filtering based on broadband PSA.

    * VicarImageBand.cpp (GetRawBandData): Fixed wrong check for failed i/o.
    * VicarImageBand.cpp (ParseBasicMetadata): Verify original width / height 
      are sane.

    * VicarImageBand.cpp (ParseExtendedMetadata): Use GetLanderLocation.
    * LogicalRecord.cpp (IsValidLabel): More noise tolerant.

    * VicarImageBand.cpp (ParseExtendedMetadata): Fixed camera event ID printed
      when user expected lander number.
    * VicarImageBand.cpp (ExamineImageVisually): When cannot guess image 
      orientation correctly, issue alert as warning, not through verbose 
      message channel.

    * configure.ac: Bumped version from 0.9 to 0.91.
    * Source/VicarImageBand.cpp: Show offsets also in hexadecimal.
    * Source/ReconstructableImage.cpp (ReconstructColourImage): More robust
      handling of matching colour band sets with differing dimensions.
