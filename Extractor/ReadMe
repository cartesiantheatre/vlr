VikingExtractor
===============

    VikingExtractor is a tool to recover mission data images from Viking lander 
    operations. This is a low level tool for advanced users that can also work 
    under an easy to use point-and-click graphical user interface intended for
    the layman provided on our Avaneya: Viking Lander Remastered DVD available 
    below.
